This is source code of my biography website, which allowed me to learn more about building website.

I use this web with 

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. Bootstrap

I'm still thinking about decorating my website more and adding more feature, if any of developers or anyone that visiting this repository and willing to suggest me any additional
feature i could implement, please contact me via in my bio or you can make push request to this repo.

I already host this website on ---> fredianrikochaniago.netlify.app
